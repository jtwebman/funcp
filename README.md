# funcp

This is just a simple immutable functional programming library for JavaScript.

The goal is to make JavaScript code easier to read and understand. I have learned
a few Functional languages now and would love to have a fast, small, library to
to the same in JavaScript but staying immutable.

## Improvements

If you want to change something or have a way to do it easier and making it
easier to read please feel free to open a issue or a pull request. My only goal
is to make things easier to read and understand not to be a pure functionalist.
